## Overview

LifeSport is an educational platform designed to connect, diversify, and facilitate access to fitness routines and exercises. Our platform aims to address the needs of individuals like Fulano, who are interested in physical training but are unsure about hiring a coach or how to proceed with their fitness journey.

## Problem Statement

Traditional sources of fitness information often provide generic and impractical advice that does not cater to the individual needs of athletes. This lack of personalized guidance hinders the effectiveness of the training process and may lead to suboptimal results.

## Solution

LifeSport offers a solution by providing access to high-quality content created by professionals affiliated with our community. Through our platform, users can access a variety of routines and exercises tailored to their specific goals and preferences.

## Our Partners

We have established partnerships with reputable professionals in the fields of health and sports training. These allies contribute their expertise to the platform and are rewarded with tokens that can be redeemed for products from our partner brands, including protein supplements, weights, clothing, and more.

## Differentiator: CheckAlly System

LifeSport features a unique verification system called CheckAlly to ensure the authenticity of our allies. This system involves two layers of verification: first, professionals are required to submit their certifications and documentation, and second, we utilize blockchain technology to verify and track these documents over time, ensuring their validity.
